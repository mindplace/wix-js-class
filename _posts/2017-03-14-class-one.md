<h2 class="header large-header">Prep work</h2>

*General note: although the information below is specific to JavaScript, these concepts are used by almost every (object oriented) programming language.*

<h3 class="header medium-header">It's time to start running JavaScript from your Terminal:<br> with Node!</h3>

<div class="video-wrap">
  <iframe width="560" class="video" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3irtVbB88_U?ecver=1" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

<h3 class="header medium-header">Steps, as shown in the video</h3>

1. Open your Terminal.
2. Use the `cd` command to walk into your coding folder.
3. Use the `mkdir` command to make a new folder called `class-one`.
4. Use the `cd` command to walk into that folder.
5. Now, make a JavaScript file called `practice.js` using the `touch` command: `touch practice.js`.
6. Open the contents of this folder `class-one` in Atom: `atom .`  With Atom now open, open the `practice.js` file that you should see in Atom's sidebar.
7. Add the line `console.log("Hello world!")` to the file. Save it.
8. In your Terminal, run the file by typing `node practice.js` (This will only work if the current folder you're in in your Terminal is the one that contains your `practice.js` file.)
9. You should see `Hello world!` (or whatever you wrote) appear on your Terminal screen as output.

Steps 7 through 9 are the process of adding code to a program, running the program, and seeing output. This is the part you'll be doing most of the time.

<h3 class="header small-header">Understanding console.log()</h3>

You need a way to be able to easily see output. Code you write will NOT automatically have output; you have to explicitly tell the program what code to show as output by using `console.log()` statements. This will print things out to your Terminal:

```javascript
// Example

console.log("Don't work more than " + 60 + " minutes at a time on this!")
// Don't work more than 60 minutes at a time on this!
```

<h3 class="header small-header">Type out every code example that you see on this page into your practice.js file.<br>For each example, run the file with Node to see what you get.</h3>

To leave code in the `practice.js` file but have it be ignored, **comment it out** by putting 2 forward slashes (`//`) at the beginning of the line. When the code turns grey, you'll know it will be ignored.

<h2 class="header medium-header">Types</h2>

"In computer science and computer programming, a *data type* or simply *type* is a classification of data which tells the compiler or interpreter how the programmer intends to use the data." - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_type" target="blank">Wikipedia</a>

**There are 5 types in JavaScript:**

* numbers
* strings
* booleans
* null
* undefined

<br>

**Numbers**<br>
Numerical values.

```javascript
// Examples

22
285749769587602878452
2.22
123e5 // 12300000
123e-5 // 0.00123
-20
0

console.log(22)
// 22

console.log(123e-5)
// 0.00123

console.log(-22)
// -22

// -----------------------------------------
// Make and test your predictions:
// what will these print out?

console.log(0.22)

```
<br>

**Strings**<br>
Text values. Always wrapped in (matching!) quotes.

```javascript
// Examples

console.log("42")
// 42

'blah'
console.log('blah')
// blah

"42"                // notice that this is not a number,
console.log("42")   // even though it has digits!
// 42

"Who says I don't like 'silly things'??"
console.log("Who says I don't like 'silly things'??")
// Who says I don't like 'silly things'??

// -----------------------------------------
// Make and test your predictions:
// what will these print out?

console.log("03/22/2017 04:33 PM EST")

console.log('Not today.')

console.log("3757456hru8348y9hrew*&#)%*&")

```

<br>

**Booleans**<br>
Literally, `true` and `false`.

```javascript
// Examples

true
console.log(true)
// true

false
console.log(false)
// false

```

<br>

**Undefined**<br>
Something that means there's no value here.

```javascript
// Examples

undefined
console.log(undefined)
// undefined

```
<br>

**Null**<br>
A special way of saying 'nothing': an actual 'nothing' space. Unlike `undefined`, this 'nothing' space is not going to be some other value in the future, it is already itself, and the thing it is is 'nothing'.

```javascript
// Examples

null
console.log(null)
// null

```

<br>

<h2 class="header medium-header">Declaring variables and assigning values</h2>

Variables, like in math, are empty boxes that are meant to hold values.
When they're just empty boxes, the 'emptiness' they hold is `undefined` (that's the point of that type!)

If I want to create a new variable, I have to **DECLARE** it:

```javascript
var myAwesomeVariable;

console.log(myAwesomeVariable);
// undefined

```

`var` is a keyword that means, 'the thing that comes next is a variable I am creating'.

(The way I named my variable is using a JavaScript convention called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case" target="blank">CamelCase</a>, where each consecutive 'word' is capitalized, instead of using underscores or dashes.)

**You can do anything to a variable that you can otherwise do to, or with, the value it holds.** If the value your variable holds is a number, you can add it to another number. If the value your variable holds is a string, you can check its length. (More on that later . . . )

Now I have a variable, but it's `undefined`, meaning it has no value (yes, it should actually be 'unassigned' or something! JavaScript wasn't originally well designed, so it has these kinds of issues). We can give it a value by **ASSIGNING** that value to it:

```javascript

var myAwesomeVariable;

console.log(myAwesomeVariable);
// undefined

myAwesomeVariable = "my awesome string";

console.log(myAwesomeVariable);
// my awesome string

```

I shouldn't use the `var` keyword when giving `myAwesomeVariable` a value, because that's only to be used when first declaring the variable. Since the variable is already declared, I don't need to re-declare it; in fact that would overwrite whatever that variable originally was.

But, I can both declare and assign a variable at the same time, and this is the most common thing to do:

```javascript
var someNumber = 2849049726;

console.log(someNumber);
// 2849049726

// -----------------------------------------
// Make and test your predictions:
// what will these print out?

var string = "something is here";
string = "another thing now";

console.log(string) // ?

```

The variables are around for as long as the program is running. You can check their values and do things to them as though you were doing those actions to those values directly. You can also overwrite their values:

```javascript
var first = 1;
var second = 2;

console.log("variable 'first' has a value of " + first);
// variable 'first' has a value of 1

first = 11;
console.log(first);
// 11

```

----

<h2 class="medium-header header">Operators</h2>

These are things that you use to act upon or compare, values.

<h3 class="small-header header">Operators that ACT UPON values</h3>

|----------|--------|
| +        |   adds | | *        | multiplies | | % | 'modulus': finds remainder |
| -        | subtracts | | /        | divides |


```javascript
// Examples

console.log(1 + 1)
// 2

console.log("33" + "2")
// 332

console.log(6 / 3)
// 2

console.log(2 * 2)
// 4

console.log(2 - 2)
// 0

console.log(6 % 2) // no remainder: often used for checking for odd or even numbers
// 0


```

<br>

<h3 class="small-header header">Operators that COMPARE values</h3>

|----------|--------|
| < | less than | | <= | less than or equal to |
| > | greater than | | >= | greater than or equal to
| == | values are equal  | | === | values AND types are equal |
| != | values are not equal | | !== | values AND types are not equal |

```javascript
// Examples

console.log(1 > 0)
// true

console.log("something" == "something")
// true

console.log(4 != '4') // checks values ...
// false

console.log(4 !== '4') // checks values AND types ...
// true

```

**A note on the equality checkers**<br>
They both check if two things are equal, but `===` checks whether the TYPES are also equal. The reason for these two different checks is because JavaScript can do what's called <a href="https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/types%20%26%20grammar/ch4.md">**type coercion**</a>, which means it can ignore whether things you are trying to manipulate are not of the same type. So if you try to add 1 + '1', it will assume you mean both of those are strings, and return '11' (rather than assuming they're both numbers and returning 2, or just failing with an error):

```javascript
// Examples

console.log(1 + '1')
// 11

console.log(2 * '3')
// 6

console.log('2' * 3)
// 6

```

Hey, are you trying things out and getting `NaN`? It's one of JavaScript's most opaque errors. `NaN` means <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_isnan.asp" target="blank">'Not a Number'</a> and basically is an error that lets you know some value is an illegal number.

<br>

Operators that manage LOGICAL COMPARISONS:

|----------|--------|
| \|\| | or | | && | and | | ! | not |

```javascript
// Examples

console.log( true || false ) // one of these is true, so expression is true
// true

console.log( !true === false) // opposite of true is false, which is equal to false and same type
// true

console.log( false && false ) // no true value here, so the result is false
// false

var one = 1;
var two = 2;

console.log(one > two)
// false

console.log(one == two)
// false

console.log(one == 1)
// true

console.log(one === 1) // value is 1, and both are number types
// true

// one of these variables is greater than one, so that expression is true
console.log( (one > 1) || (two > 1) )
// true

console.log( (one > 0) && (two > 0) ) // both are greater than zero
// true


// -----------------------------------------
// Make and test your predictions:
// what will these print out?

console.log( (one + two) > (two + 1))

console.log( (one < two ) === true )

// By the way, how many expressions are there in each of these examples? Some have more than one expression per line.

```
<br>

Operator that **ASSIGNS VALUE**:

| = | assigns |

Note that this operator does NOT check for equality!

<br>

And a special one: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/typeof" target="blank">`typeof`</a>

`typeof` is an operator that returns the TYPE of the thing you test against it.

```javascript
// Examples

console.log(typeof "22")
// string

console.log(typeof 22)
// number

console.log(typeof undefined)
// undefined

console.log(typeof true)
// boolean

console.log(typeof null) // This one is a legacy bug!
// object                // Left over from JS's early days.   

```
<br>

<h3 class="header header-small">Operators result in 'expressions'</h3>

All operators create EXPRESSIONS. Some of these expressions result in new values (such as when you're assigning values to a variable) and some result in `true` or `false`:

```javascript
// Examples

console.log(2 > 2)
// false

console.log(2 == 2)
// true

```

<h2 class="header medium-header">Arrays</h2>  

`arrays` are ways of collecting values. Think of an `array` as a list: each new line is a separate item. Items are always separated by commas. `arrays` can hold ANY kind of thing, including other `arrays` and variables:

```javascript
// Examples
var ratings = [3, 4, 5, 2, 5, 5, 4, 5]

var votedForSomething = [true, false, false, true, false, false, true, false ]

var emptyArrayWithThreeSpots = [ undefined, undefined, undefined ]

var gameOfThronesCharacters = [
  "Jon Snow",               // notice this array is on multiple lines; as long as
  "Arya Stark",             // there are commas between values, this is perfectly fine.
  "Tyrion Lannister"
]

var myMixedArray = [ 42, "something", true, null, undefined, false, "another" ];

var flowerOne = "daffodil";
var flowerTwo = "daisy";
var flowerThree = "buttercup";

var garden = [flowerOne, flowerTwo, flowerThree];

var studentGrades = [
  [ "Laura", [ 88, 95, 76 ] ],
  [ "Arthur", [ 66, 100, 93 ] ],
  [ "Jen", [ 75, 85, 90 ] ]
];

```

Each item in an `array` has a location, called an `index`. The `index` is automatically assigned based on where in the `array` the item is. If it's in first place, its `index` is 0. Second place is `index` 1, third is `index` 2 . . . and so on. If you move items around inside an array, the items get their new `index` based on the location of the new place they occupy in the `array`; they don't keep the `index` of their original order. To get an item from an `array` by its `index`:

```javascript
var myArray = [ 42, "something", true ];

console.log(myArray[0]) // first element from myArray.
// 42                   // Or, 'item at location 0 in myArray'

// -----------------------------------------
// Make and test your predictions:
// what will these print out?

console.log(myArray[2])

console.log(myArray[100]) // tricky!

```

---

<h2 class="header medium-header">Objects</h2>

This is the main building block of JavaScript. `objects` are like `arrays` in that they contain collections of values, but instead of being located by `indexes`, `objects` contain values that are located by `keys`:

```javascript
var myObject = {
  myFirstKey: "something",
  mySecondKey: 22,
  myThirdKey: [1, 2, 3]
}
```

To find out the value of mySecondKey:

```javascript
var myObject = {
  myFirstKey: "something",
  mySecondKey: 22,
  myThirdKey: [1, 2, 3]
}

console.log(myObject.mySecondKey);
// 22

```

I can add new `keys` with values, or I can edit the values at some available `key`, using the assignment operator `=`:

```javascript
console.log(myObject.myFirstKey);
// something

myObject.myFirstKey = "another something";

console.log(myObject.myFirstKey);
// another something

console.log(myObject.somethingElseEntirely);
// undefined

myObject.somethingElseEntirely = true;

console.log(myObject.somethingElseEntirely);
// true

```
<br>

Here's a more complex `object`:

```javascript
var myDog = {
  name: "Ash",
  cute: true,
  age: 3,
  color: "Seal brown",
  toys: ["teddy bear", "pig ear", "socks"],
  medicalHistory: {
    vet: "Dr Awesome Vet",
    surgeries: 3,
    successesOfVisits: [90, 100, 85, 99],
    shots: {
      rabies: true,
      giarda: false
    }
  }
}
```

Notice that `keys` are not `strings`, they are words without spaces that end in a colon ( : ). Also notice that after every value (no matter what kind of value it is, whether it be a `string`, `boolean`, or even an `array` or `object`) there is a comma.

If I wanted to check the value at `cute`, I would do it like this:

```javascript
console.log(myDog.cute)
// true
```

if I wanted to know whether my dog has the giarda shot, I would do it like this:

```javascript
var ashHasGiarda = myDog.medicalHistory.shots.giarda;

console.log(ashHasGiarda)
// false

// -----------------------------------------
// Make and test your predictions:
// what will these print out?

console.log(myDog['age'])

console.log(myDog.age)

console.log(myDog.friends)

console.log(myDog['toys'][0])

```

<h3 class="header medium-header">Homework</h3>

Declare a variable `student`. This variable should have a value of an object. Give this object 4 keys and values:

* `enrolledInClasses` should be `true`
* `grades` should be an `array` of 5 numerical grades
* `name` should be a `string`
* `dorm` should be an `object`, with 2 keys: `address` and `roommate` (make up values)

Use `console.log()` to print out various information available on this object.

Without writing it into your original object, add some new key: `myStudent.myNewKey = "some new value"`

**Bonus**: print out information about the student in a single very long `string` by using `+` to add smaller strings together.
