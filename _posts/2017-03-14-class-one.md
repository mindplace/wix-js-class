<h2 class="header large-header">Prep work</h2>

*General note: although the information below is specific to JavaScript, these concepts are used by almost every (object oriented) programming language.*

<h3 class="header medium-header">It's time to start running JavaScript from your Terminal:<br> with Node!</h3>

<div class="video-wrap">
  <iframe width="560" class="video" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3irtVbB88_U?ecver=1" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

<h3 class="header medium-header">Steps, as shown in the video</h3>

1. Open your Terminal.
2. Use the `cd` command to walk into your coding folder.
3. Use the `mkdir` command to make a new folder called `class-one`.
4. Use the `cd` command to walk into that folder.
5. Now, make a JavaScript file called `practice.js` using the `touch` command: `touch practice.js`.
6. Open the contents of this folder `class-one` in Atom: `atom .`  With Atom now open, open the `practice.js` file that you should see in Atom's sidebar.
7. Add the line `console.log("Hello world!")` to the file. Save it.
8. In your Terminal, run the file by typing `node practice.js` (This will only work if the current folder you're in in your Terminal is the one that contains your `practice.js` file.)
9. You should see `Hello world!` (or whatever you wrote) appear on your Terminal screen as output.

Steps 7 through 9 are the process of adding code to a program, running the program, and seeing output. This is the part you'll be doing most of the time.

<h3 class="header small-header">Understanding console.log()</h3>

You need a way to be able to easily see output. Code you write will NOT automatically have output; you have to explicitly tell the program what code to show as output by using `console.log()` statements. This will print things out to your Terminal:

```javascript
// Example

console.log("Don't work more than " + 60 + " minutes at a time on this!")
// Don't work more than 60 minutes at a time on this!
```

<h3 class="header small-header">Type out every code example that you see on this page into your practice.js file.<br>For each example, run the file with Node to see what you get.</h3>

To leave code in the `practice.js` file but have it be ignored, **comment it out** by putting 2 forward slashes (`//`) at the beginning of the line. When the code turns grey, you'll know it will be ignored.

<h2 class="header medium-header">Types</h2>

"In computer science and computer programming, a *data type* or simply *type* is a classification of data which tells the compiler or interpreter how the programmer intends to use the data." - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_type" target="blank">Wikipedia</a>

**There are 5 types in JavaScript:**

* numbers
* strings
* booleans
* null
* undefined

<br>

**Numbers**<br>
Numerical values.

```javascript
// Examples

22
285749769587602878452
2.22
123e5 // 12300000
123e-5 // 0.00123
-20
0

console.log(22)
// 22

console.log(123e-5)
// 0.00123

console.log(-22)
// -22

// -----------------------------------------
// Make and test your predictions:
// what will these print out?

console.log(0.22)

```
<br>

**Strings**<br>
Text values. Always wrapped in (matching!) quotes.

```javascript
// Examples

console.log("42")
// 42

'blah'
console.log('blah')
// blah

"42"                // notice that this is not a number,
console.log("42")   // even though it has digits!
// 42

"Who says I don't like 'silly things'??"
console.log("Who says I don't like 'silly things'??")
// Who says I don't like 'silly things'??

// -----------------------------------------
// Make and test your predictions:
// what will these print out?

console.log("03/22/2017 04:33 PM EST")

console.log('Not today.')

console.log("3757456hru8348y9hrew*&#)%*&")

```

<br>

**Booleans**<br>
Literally, `true` and `false`.

```javascript
// Examples

true
console.log(true)
// true

false
console.log(false)
// false

```

<br>

**Undefined**<br>
Something that means there's no value here.

```javascript
// Examples

undefined
console.log(undefined)
// undefined

```
<br>

**Null**<br>
A special way of saying 'nothing': an actual 'nothing' space. Unlike `undefined`, this 'nothing' space is not going to be some other value in the future, it is already itself, and the thing it is is 'nothing'.

```javascript
// Examples

null
console.log(null)
// null

```

<br>

<h2 class="header medium-header">Declaring variables and assigning values</h2>

Variables, like in math, are empty boxes that are meant to hold values.
When they're just empty boxes, the 'emptiness' they hold is `undefined` (that's the point of that type!)

If I want to create a new variable, I have to **DECLARE** it:

```javascript
var myAwesomeVariable;

console.log(myAwesomeVariable);
// undefined

```

`var` is a keyword that means, 'the thing that comes next is a variable I am creating'.

(The way I named my variable is using a JavaScript convention called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case" target="blank">CamelCase</a>, where each consecutive 'word' is capitalized, instead of using underscores or dashes.)

**You can do anything to a variable that you can otherwise do to, or with, the value it holds.** If the value your variable holds is a number, you can add it to another number. If the value your variable holds is a string, you can check its length. (More on that later . . . )

Now I have a variable, but it's `undefined`, meaning it has no value (yes, it should actually be 'unassigned' or something! JavaScript wasn't originally well designed, so it has these kinds of issues). We can give it a value by **ASSIGNING** that value to it:

```javascript

var myAwesomeVariable;

console.log(myAwesomeVariable);
// undefined

myAwesomeVariable = "my awesome string";

console.log(myAwesomeVariable);
// my awesome string

```

I shouldn't use the `var` keyword when giving `myAwesomeVariable` a value, because that's only to be used when first declaring the variable. Since the variable is already declared, I don't need to re-declare it; in fact that would overwrite whatever that variable originally was.

But, I can both declare and assign a variable at the same time, and this is the most common thing to do:

```javascript
var someNumber = 2849049726;

console.log(someNumber);
// 2849049726

// -----------------------------------------
// Make and test your predictions:
// what will these print out?

var string = "something is here";
string = "another thing now";

console.log(string) // ?

```

The variables are around for as long as the program is running. You can check their values and do things to them as though you were doing those actions to those values directly. You can also overwrite their values:

```javascript
var first = 1;
var second = 2;

console.log("variable 'first' has a value of " + first);
// variable 'first' has a value of 1

first = 11;
console.log(first);
// 11

```

<h2 class="medium-header header">Operators</h2>

These are things that you use to act upon or compare, values.

<h3 class="small-header header">Operators that ACT UPON values</h3>

|----------|--------|
| +        |   adds | | *        | multiplies | | % | 'modulus': finds remainder |
| -        | subtracts | | /        | divides |


```javascript
// Examples

console.log(1 + 1)
// 2

console.log("33" + "2")
// 332

console.log(6 / 3)
// 2

console.log(2 * 2)
// 4

console.log(2 - 2)
// 0

console.log(6 % 2) // no remainder: often used for checking for odd or even numbers
// 0


```
