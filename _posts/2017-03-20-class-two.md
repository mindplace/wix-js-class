<h3 class="header medium-header">Running JavaScript from your Terminal with Node!</h3>

<div class="video-wrap">
  <iframe width="560" class="video" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3irtVbB88_U?ecver=1" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

<h3 class="header medium-header">Steps, as shown in the video</h3>

1. Open your Terminal.
2. Use the `cd` command to walk into your coding folder.
3. Use the `mkdir` command to make a new folder called `class-two`.
4. Use the `cd` command to walk into that folder.
5. Now, make a JavaScript file called `practice.js` using the `touch` command: `touch practice.js`.
6. Open the contents of this folder `class-two` in Atom: `atom .`  With Atom now open, open the `practice.js` file that you should see in Atom's sidebar.
7. Add the line `console.log("Hello world!")` to the file. Save it.
8. In your Terminal, run the file by typing `node practice.js` (This will only work if the current folder you're in in your Terminal is the one that contains your `practice.js` file.)
9. You should see `Hello world!` (or whatever you wrote) appear on your Terminal screen as output.

Steps 7 through 9 are the process of adding code to a program, running the program, and seeing output. This is the part you'll be doing most of the time.

<h3 class="header small-header">Type out every code example that you see on this page into your practice.js file.<br>For each example, run the file with Node to see what you get.</h3>

To leave code in the `practice.js` file but have it be ignored, **comment it out** by putting 2 forward slashes (`//`) at the beginning of the line. When the code turns grey, you'll know it will be ignored.

<h2 class="header medium-header">Operators, Part 2</h2>

All operators create EXPRESSIONS. Some of these expressions result in new values (such as when you're assigning values to a variable) and some result in `true` or `false`. Here's some examples of expressions:

```javascript
// Examples

console.log(2 > 4)
// false

console.log("this" != "that")
// true

console.log(x = 2)
// 2

```

Guess which parts below are expressions. Sometimes there will be multiple expressions on a single line.

<br>

<h3 class="small-header header">Operators that COMPARE values</h3>

|----------|--------|
| < | less than | | <= | less than or equal to |
| > | greater than | | >= | greater than or equal to
| == | values are equal  | | === | values AND types are equal |
| != | values are not equal | | !== | values AND types are not equal |

```javascript
// Examples

console.log(1 > 0)
// true

console.log("something" == "something")
// true

console.log(4 != '4') // checks values ...
// false

console.log(4 !== '4') // checks values AND types ...
// true

```

**A note on the equality checkers**<br>
They both check if two things are equal, but `===` checks whether the TYPES are also equal. The reason for these two different checks is because JavaScript can do what's called <a href="https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/types%20%26%20grammar/ch4.md">**type coercion**</a>, which means it can ignore whether things you are trying to manipulate are not of the same type. So if you try to add 1 + '1', it will assume you mean both of those are strings, and return '11' (rather than assuming they're both numbers and returning 2, or just failing with an error).

```javascript
// Examples

console.log(1 + '1') // converts number to string
// 11

console.log(2 * '3') // converts string to number
// 6

console.log('2' - 1) // converts string to number
// 1

```

<br>

<h3 class="small-header header">Operators that manage LOGICAL COMPARISONS</h3>

|----------|--------|
| \|\| | or | | && | and |
| ! | not |

```javascript
// Examples

console.log( true || false ) // one of these is true, so expression is true
// true

console.log( !true === false) // opposite of true is false, which is equal to false and same type
// true

console.log( false && false ) // no true value here, so the result is false
// false

var one = 1;
var two = 2;

console.log(one > two)
// false

console.log(one == two)
// false

console.log(one == 1)
// true


console.log(one === 1) // value is 1, and both are number types
// true                // how many expressions are here?

// one of these variables is greater than one, so that expression is true
console.log( (one > 1) || (two > 1) ) // how many expressions are here?
// true

console.log( (one > 0) && (two > 0) ) // both are greater than zero
// true                               // how many expressions are here?


// -----------------------------------------
// Make and test your predictions:
// what will these print out?

console.log( (one + two) > (two + 1))

console.log( (one < two ) === true )

```

<br>

And a special one: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/typeof" target="blank">`typeof`</a>

`typeof` is an operator that returns the TYPE of the thing you test against it.

```javascript
// Examples

console.log(typeof "22")
// string

console.log(typeof 22)
// number

console.log(typeof undefined)
// undefined

console.log(typeof true)
// boolean

console.log(typeof null) // This one is a legacy bug!
// object                // Left over from JS's early days.   

```

<h2 class="header medium-header">Arrays</h2>  

`arrays` are ways of collecting values. Think of an `array` as a list: each new line is a separate item. Items are always separated by commas. `arrays` can hold ANY kind of thing, including other `arrays` and variables:

```javascript
// Examples
var ratings = [3, 4, 5, 2, 5, 5, 4, 5]

var votedForSomething = [true, false, false, true, false, false, true, false ]

var emptyArrayWithThreeSpots = [ undefined, undefined, undefined ]

var gameOfThronesCharacters = [
  "Jon Snow",               // notice this array is on multiple lines; as long as
  "Arya Stark",             // there are commas between values, this is perfectly fine.
  "Tyrion Lannister"
]

var myMixedArray = [ 42, "something", true, null, undefined, false, "another" ];

var flowerOne = "daffodil";
var flowerTwo = "daisy";
var flowerThree = "buttercup";

var garden = [flowerOne, flowerTwo, flowerThree];

var studentGrades = [
  [ "Laura", [ 88, 95, 76 ] ],
  [ "Arthur", [ 66, 100, 93 ] ],
  [ "Jen", [ 75, 85, 90 ] ]
];

```

Each item in an `array` has a location, called an `index`. The `index` is automatically assigned based on where in the `array` the item is. If it's in first place, its `index` is 0. Second place is `index` 1, third is `index` 2 . . . and so on. If you move items around inside an array, the items get their new `index` based on the location of the new place they occupy in the `array`; they don't keep the `index` of their original order. To get an item from an `array` by its `index`:

```javascript
var myArray = [ 42, "something", true ];

console.log(myArray[0]) // first element from myArray.
// 42                   // Or, 'item at location 0 in myArray'

// -----------------------------------------
// Make and test your predictions:
// what will these print out?

console.log(myArray[2])

console.log(myArray[100]) // tricky!

```

<h2 class="header medium-header">Objects</h2>

This is the main building block of JavaScript. `objects` are like `arrays` in that they contain collections of values, but instead of being located by `indexes`, `objects` contain values that are located by `keys`:

```javascript
var myObject = {
  myFirstKey: "something",
  mySecondKey: 22,
  myThirdKey: [1, 2, 3]
}
```

To find out the value of mySecondKey:

```javascript
var myObject = {
  myFirstKey: "something",
  mySecondKey: 22,
  myThirdKey: [1, 2, 3]
}

console.log(myObject.mySecondKey);
// 22

```

I can add new `keys` with values, or I can edit the values at some available `key`, using the assignment operator `=`:

```javascript
console.log(myObject.myFirstKey);
// something

myObject.myFirstKey = "another something";

console.log(myObject.myFirstKey);
// another something

console.log(myObject.somethingElseEntirely);
// undefined

myObject.somethingElseEntirely = true;

console.log(myObject.somethingElseEntirely);
// true

```
<br>

Here's a more complex `object`:

```javascript
var myDog = {
  name: "Ash",
  cute: true,
  age: 3,
  color: "Seal brown",
  toys: ["teddy bear", "pig ear", "socks"],
  medicalHistory: {
    vet: "Dr Awesome Vet",
    surgeries: 3,
    successesOfVisits: [90, 100, 85, 99],
    shots: {
      rabies: true,
      giarda: false
    }
  }
}
```

Notice that `keys` are not `strings`, they are words without spaces that end in a colon ( : ). Also notice that after every value (no matter what kind of value it is, whether it be a `string`, `boolean`, or even an `array` or `object`) there is a comma.

If I wanted to check the value at `cute`, I would do it like this:

```javascript
console.log(myDog.cute)
// true
```

if I wanted to know whether my dog has the giarda shot, I would do it like this:

```javascript
var ashHasGiarda = myDog.medicalHistory.shots.giarda;

console.log(ashHasGiarda)
// false

// -----------------------------------------
// Make and test your predictions:
// what will these print out?

console.log(myDog['age'])

console.log(myDog.age)

console.log(myDog.friends)

console.log(myDog['toys'][0])

```

<h3 class="header medium-header">Your turn</h3>

Declare a variable `student`. This variable should have a value of an object. Give this object 4 keys and values:

* `enrolledInClasses` should be `true`
* `grades` should be an `array` of 5 numerical grades
* `name` should be a `string`
* `dorm` should be an `object`, with 2 keys: `address` and `roommate` (make up values)

Use `console.log()` to print out various information available on this object.

Without writing it into your original object, add some new key: `myStudent.myNewKey = "some new value"`

**Bonus**: print out information about the student in a single very long `string` by using `+` to add smaller strings together.
