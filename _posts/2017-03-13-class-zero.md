<h2 class="header medium-header">Setting up your development environment</h2>

You'll need a way to write HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code on your personal computer. While web browsers already have this functionality (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc) it would be unproductive to rely solely on them.

<h3 class="header small-header">Download a code editor.</h3>

Just as you write regular documents in a text editor like Microsoft Word or even something super simple like Notepad, you need a program that will let you write code. Microsoft Word etc will not do this properly, because text editors add a lot of markup (additional characters) to the text saved in them, which would effectively corrupt the code you write.

Download [Atom](https://atom.io/) or [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/download). These are some of the best rated (and free!) code editors around. If you already have a code editor, use that. The important thing is to be able to create and edit files ending in `.js`, `.html`, `.css`, `.md`, etc. *My recommendation: use **Atom**.*

<h2 class="header medium-header">HTML and CSS, and why you need to know them</h2>

We may not get to cover HTML and CSS in any depth. That said, these are possibly more important than JavaScript for web development, in that HTML and CSS actually define the content on any webpage from any website. If you want to manipulate page elements using JavaScript, you cannot do so without at least a basic understanding of HTML and CSS.
